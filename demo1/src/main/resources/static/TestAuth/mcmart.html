	<center><h3>Bapuji – Nandlal Bose</h3></center>
	<br>
	<p>Everybody knows about Mahatma Gandhi as one of the greatest freedom fighters the world has ever seen. But how many among us know that Bapu has been a muse for many of his contemporary artists both in India and abroad? The legendary Nandalal Bose, an artist of Shantiniketan during the life time of Gandhi, had stated that Bapu was an inspiration for all artists. His famous linocut portrait of the Mahatma titled ‘Dandi March’ (with the legend Bapuji, 1930, inscribed on it) created in 1930, reflects his respect for Gandhi and is on permanent display at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Delhi.</p>

		<center><h3>Self Portrait – Amrita Sher-Gil</h3></center>
	<br>
    <p>This is a 1931 self-portrait by Amrita Sher-Gil, depicting one of India’s most important modern artists at the age of 18. This is the also first painting by the artist ever to be offered in Christie’s London, and one of only eight canvases by Sher-Gil to be offered at auction globally. Sher-Gil’s self-portraits are painted with an intensity that is almost hypnotic, drawing the viewer into the innermost psyche of the artist, where one discovers a sea of melancholy.</p>

		<center><h3>Saraswati –Raja Ravi Varma</h3></center>	<br>
     <p>The earliest known mention of Saraswati as a goddess is in the Rigveda. She has remained significant as a goddess from the Vedic period through modern times of Hindu traditions.[5] Some Hindus celebrate the festival of Vasant Panchami (the fifth day of spring) in her honour,[6] and mark the day by helping young children learn how to write alphabets on that day.[7]The Goddess is also revered by believers of the Jain religion of west and central India,[8] as well as some Buddhist sects.</p>

		<center><h3>Self-Portrait – Rabindranath Tagore</h3></center>
	<br>
<p>Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore started painting in 1924 at the age of 63, though long before this, an element of effort could be noticed in the various corrections and doodles in his manuscripts. Towards the end of his career, Tagore, striving to create a universally accessible art, took up painting more consistently. He made thousands of sketches and drawings using brush, pencil and pen, the most famous of them being his self-portrait. This painting depicts the full-face, self-portrait of the bearded artist, enhanced by the lack of colour, unworked background and the use of primitive looking pencil lines.</p>	</div>

		<center><h3>Krishna (Spring in Kullu) – Nicholas Roerich</h3></center>
	<br>
<p>One cannot overlook the claim of Krishna (Spring in Kullu) by famous Russian artist Nicholas Roerich while talking about famous Indian art work. The painting that is on permanent display at Nicholas Roerich Museum, New York has Krishna playing the flute under a tree in blossom with majestic snow covered mountains in the backdrop. Roerich, who after having traveled the world, made Kullu his home and died there. In 1979, he was declared by ASI as one of the nine artists whose work are considered national art treasures.</p>	</div>
