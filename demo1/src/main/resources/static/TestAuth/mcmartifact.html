	<br>
	<p style="text-align:justify">This is a copper chocolate pot with a removable lid. It is an example of an English Georgian chocolate pot, but was most likely made in the United States. The stepped lid has a small cover that pivots on a rivet for a molinillo (whisk) opening. It has a seamed and dovetailed body with an elongated, s-shaped spout attached the body at an angle. A long, wooden handle is fitted inside the copper cylinder and attached to the lower portion of the body with three brass rivets.</p>

		<center><h3>Miner’s Cap and Carbide Lamp</h3></center>	<br>
        <p style="text-align:justify">This cotton miner’s cap has a leather brim with a leather lamp bracket holding a carbide lamp. A small union pin that reads “United Mine Works of America 2 1934, Working Button” is attached to the side of the cap. Before head protection became mandatory in industrial workplaces, miner’s caps served as a way to mount their lamps.The union pin on this mining cap speaks to the personal connections miner’s had with their cap. A miner chose their headgear, and took it with them to work where it was worn all day and used for decades. It wasn’t uncommon for miner’s to personalize their helmet with stickers or their caps with pins.</p>

		<center><h3>Edison's "New Year's Eve" Lamp</h3></center>
	<br>
	<p style="text-align:justify">Thomas Edison used this carbon-filament bulb in the first public demonstration of his most famous invention, the first practical electric incandescent lamp, which took place at his Menlo Park, New Jersey, laboratory on New Year's Eve, 1879. As the quintessential American inventor-hero, Edison personified the ideal of the hardworking self-made man. He received a record 1,093 patents and became a skilled entrepreneur. Though occasionally unsuccessful, Edison and his team developed many practical devices in his "invention factory," and fostered faith in technological progress.</p>

		<center><h3>Morse Telegraph Register</h3></center>
	<br>
	<p style="text-align:justify">Telegraph register, manufactured in accord with the Morse patent, was installed in 1848 in South Bend, reputedly the first telegraph office in Indiana. Stamped on the base is "j. Burritt & son ithaca." Pulses of electricity caused the two vertical electromagnets (on the right) to pull against an iron bar attached to the horizontal brass lever arm. The other end of the arm then pressed a metal stylus against a strip of paper tape (not shown) which was pulled through a pair of rollers by the clockwork mechanism. This caused short and long marks (dots and dashes) to be embossed on the paper.</p>
