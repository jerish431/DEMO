	<center><h3>Coins Of Mughal</h3></center>
	<br>
    <p style="text-align:justify">History of Indian coins should help in discovering the personal traits of individual kings who had indeed issued them. For instance, Muhammad Bin Tughlaq from Tughlaq Dynasty, who has always been considered much ahead of his times, had minted coins in the name of his dead father whom he had slain in repentance during his early years of rule. The coining history of India once more took a dramatic turn under the advent of the Mughal Dynasty in the early 16th century.</p>

	<center><h3>Coin Of Kushan</h3></center>
	<br>
	<p style="text-align:justify">The Indo-Greek Kushan kings who came next introduced the Greek custom of engraving portrait heads on coins. Their example was followed for eight centuries. The extensive coinage of the Kushan empire also influenced a large number of tribes, dynasties, and kingdoms, which began issuing their own coins.Kushan coins had the diademed, helmeted bust of the king on one side, and the king’s favourite deity on the reverse.</p>	</div>

	<p style="text-align:justify">Made of silver of a standard weight but with irregular shapes, these coins had different markings – for example, Saurashtra had a humped bull, Dakshin Panchala had a Swastika, and Magadha had several symbols.Then came the Mauryas who punch marked their coins with a royal standard. Chanakya, prime minister to the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya, mentions the minting of coins such as rupyarupa (silver),  suvarnarupa (gold), tamararupa (copper) and sisarupa (lead) in his Arthashastra treatise.</p>
